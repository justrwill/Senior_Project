# SENIOR PROJECT

## Overview
This project's aim is to resolve challenges in second-language acquisition by creating a software application that integrates language learning with media, specifically those in image formats. Traditional methods lack the engagement that research suggests enhances learning outcomes and bolsters retention. Using the theories from Krashen, Pica, and others as a basis, the application attempts to leverage comprehensible input to enhance users' sentence structure understanding, learning retention, and learning efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR.
- **Dictionary Integration:** Provides definitions from an input language to a target language via APIs.
- **Research-Based Design:** Incorporates language learning research for effective and engaging educational outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Python
- Tesseract OCR
- Flask (current framework for the project)
- Plans for future expansion into Django for scalability and personalized learning tools.

## Project Structure
- The main project is located in the `flask_project` folder.

## Objective
By using language learning research as a foundation, this project seeks to create a fun, effective, and efficient application. The goal is to provide an avenue for language learners to enjoy foreign media while effectively achieving learning outcomes.
